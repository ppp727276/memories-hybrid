/**
 * Vault-local artifact store for the MCP tool-result preview budget
 * (v0.18.0).
 *
 * When an MCP tool result exceeds its preview budget, the full
 * serialized payload is parked here so a text-only agent can pull it
 * back through `brain_artifact_get` instead of having it flood the
 * context window inline. Artifacts are ephemeral session scratch:
 *
 *   Brain/.artifacts/<run-id>/<artifact-id>.json
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - One store per MCP server process; the `runId` groups a process's
 *   outputs so they prune together.
 * - `artifactId` is a short SHA-256 of the persisted text - deterministic,
 *   dedupes identical payloads, depends on no clock or RNG.
 * - The text is run through `redactRawOutput` before it touches disk, so
 *   a tool that happened to surface a secret-shaped token never persists
 *   it. The returned `text`/`fullChars` reflect the redacted bytes so the
 *   caller's preview slice stays consistent with what was stored.
 * - Path construction funnels through `artifactPath` (→ `ensureInsideVault`),
 *   so a malformed `artifactId` from an MCP argument cannot traverse out.
 * - Pruning is best-effort and synchronous at construction time: no
 *   daemon, matching the "no hidden process" convention. The dot-directory
 *   is excluded from the vault walker exactly like `Brain/.snapshots`.
