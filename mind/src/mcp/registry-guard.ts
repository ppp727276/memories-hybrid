/**
 * Registry guard (token-diet, t_352fd7f6 + t_c967abaf).
 *
 * One walk over the assembled tool table backs two contract tests:
 *
 *   1. Description caps - tool descriptions and per-property schema
 *      descriptions have hard character ceilings so the serialized
 *      registry (paid by every MCP client on every request in
 *      non-deferred hosts) cannot silently regrow. Long-form guidance
 *      belongs in server instructions or docs/mcp.md, not in schemas.
 *   2. Preview-budget default - every tool either carries a
 *      `previewBudget` or appears in the explicit exempt list below
 *      with a reason. Unbounded tool output is a deliberate, reviewed
 *      property, never an accident of omission.
 *
 * Test-time module: nothing here runs on the MCP request path.
