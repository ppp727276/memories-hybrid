/**
 * `dream` — the only mutating batch operation in the Brain layer.
 *
 * `dream` reads the current Brain state and decides which transitions
 * to apply. It is deterministic given the inputs and the configured
 * time (the `--now` parameter). The algorithm is anchored in design
 * doc §7.3 and the per-rule clarifications in §7.4.
 *
 * Outputs (high level):
 *
 *   - Pre-run snapshot under `Brain/.snapshots/<run_id>.tar.zst`,
 *     created BEFORE any state-changing write so a crash mid-run can
 *     be rolled back atomically.
 *   - New / updated files in `Brain/preferences/`.
 *   - Moves into `Brain/retired/`.
 *   - Moves from `Brain/inbox/` into `Brain/inbox/processed/`.
 *   - One appended event in `Brain/log/<today>.md` summarising the
 *     run — **only** if any state actually changed. Idempotent reruns
 *     touch nothing.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *
 *   - Same-sign signals on an active preference are noted (moved to
 *     `processed/`, log event `noted-redundant`) but do NOT create a
 *     second preference and do NOT increment `applied_count`.
 *   - Opposite-sign signals against an active preference accumulate
 *     toward a rebuttal. Hitting `candidate_threshold` retires the
 *     active preference (reason `rebutted`) UNLESS it is pinned, in
 *     which case the rebut attempt is logged as a `retain-pinned`
 *     event and the preference stays.
 *   - Corrupted frontmatter on a single file produces a
 *     `skip-corrupted-frontmatter` log event and is skipped. The run
 *     continues for the rest of the tree.
 *   - dryRun mode returns the planned summary but performs no writes.
