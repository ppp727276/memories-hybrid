/**
 * Cross-agent shared memory namespace (Agent Write Contract Suite,
 * t_936a1a61).
 *
 * Opt-in: the `shared_namespace` device-config key names a second
 * vault root. When set, explicit remember-writes (feedback signals and
 * narrative notes) MIRROR there after the primary write succeeds, so
 * facts learned by one agent become visible to every agent sharing the
 * namespace. Attribution is carried twice: the existing `agent` field
 * plus `origin_vault` (basename of the primary vault).
 *
 * Mirror semantics are FAIL-SOFT by contract: any mirror failure is
 * swallowed and reported as `"failed"` - it must never break, delay,
 * or alter the primary write. Default (key absent) is `"off"` with
 * zero behavior change. One-way by design: the shared vault's own
 * dream pass treats mirrored records as ordinary first-class signals.
