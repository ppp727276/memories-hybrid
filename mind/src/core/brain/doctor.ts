/**
 * Brain layer invariant checker (design doc §13.5).
 *
 * Pure read. Walks `<vault>/Brain/` and reports a list of issues. The
 * caller decides the exit code: warnings are non-blocking, errors
 * indicate a corrupt state. The CLI (`o2b brain doctor [--strict]`)
 * wraps the result; this module ships the structured object.
 *
 * Invariants checked:
 *
 *   1. **Schema version.** `Brain/_brain.yaml schema_version` is known
 *      to this build. Unknown → error.
 *   2. **Required fields per kind.** Signal / preference / retired
 *      frontmatter parses through the Task 2 parsers, which throw on
 *      missing required fields. We re-wrap the throw as an error issue.
 *   3. **Status-vs-folder.** A file in `preferences/` whose status is
 *      not `unconfirmed` / `confirmed` is a warning; a file in
 *      `retired/` whose status is not `retired` is a warning.
 *      `BrainStatusFolderMismatchError` from the parsers feeds this.
 *   4. **Broken wikilinks.** Every `[[basename]]` referenced by
 *      `evidenced_by`, `supersedes`, `superseded_by`, or `retired_by`
 *      on any Brain artifact must resolve to an existing Markdown file
 *      somewhere inside `Brain/` (basename match, Obsidian-style).
 *      Unresolved → warning.
 *   5. **Duplicate id.** Two distinct files whose frontmatter `id` is
 *      identical → error.
 *   6. **Invalid ISO.** `created_at`, `unconfirmed_until`,
 *      `confirmed_at`, `last_evidence_at`, `retired_at` parse as
 *      ISO-8601 timestamps (`null` / missing acceptable for the
 *      optional ones). Bad → error.
 *   7. **Log header parsing.** Every malformed `## <HH:MM:SS>Z — kind`
 *      block surfaced by `parseLogDayFile` (per shard) is forwarded here.
 *
 * The function never mutates state. It will gracefully tolerate a
 * vault that has no Brain layer yet (returns clean) — same shape as
 * the existing `doctor` legacy command on an empty vault.
