/**
 * Batch-plan step for large-folder ingest (A3, t_9eeb8ca2).
 *
 * OSB's ingest pipeline ({@link ingestSource}) handles ONE source at a time and
 * has no planner to shard a large folder into bounded parallel work. This module
 * supplies that planner: {@link planBatches} discovers the ingestible files under
 * a source directory, consults A1's content-hash manifest to skip everything that
 * is `unchanged` since the last ingest, and splits the `new`/`modified` remainder
 * into size+count-bounded batches. The caller (an agent or the CLI) dispatches
 * each batch as a parallel subagent - the kernel runs NO ingestion and spawns NO
 * subagents itself. Planning stays deterministic and model-free.
 *
 * Determinism: files are discovered by a stable recursive walk, sorted by their
 * canonical vault-relative path, then packed greedily - each batch is filled up
 * to the byte cap and the file-count cap, whichever binds first. The same
 * directory (same bytes on disk) always yields the same batch list.
 *
 * Ingestibility mirrors the pipeline's "text-bearing sources only" contract (no
 * OCR, binary, or media): a small, extensible set of text/document extensions.
 * The match is language-agnostic - it is over file extension and bytes, never
 * over natural-language content. Hidden files and dot-directories (`.git`,
 * `.open-second-brain`, ...) are skipped so machine artifacts never masquerade
 * as ingestible sources.
