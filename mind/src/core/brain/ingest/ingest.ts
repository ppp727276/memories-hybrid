/**
 * Source-ingest pipeline (Knowledge Provenance suite).
 *
 * Turns one text-bearing source (a document, note, or URL's text) into
 * cross-referenced Brain knowledge: the entities and concepts it mentions
 * become registry pages, and a per-source summary page links back to the raw
 * artifact, lists the entities it introduced, and lists its connections to
 * material already in the brain.
 *
 * Provider-agnostic: the calling agent extracts the entities/relations and
 * writes the prose summary; this pipeline never runs a model. OSB owns the
 * deterministic half - routing the extraction through the shared intake
 * primitive, stamping provenance, and committing the summary page idempotently
 * (one source path maps to one summary page, rewritten in place on re-ingest,
 * never duplicated). Text-bearing sources only: no OCR, binary, or media path.
 *
 * The connections list is derived, not guessed: an entity that ALREADY existed
 * before this ingest (the intake reports it as updated, not created) is a
 * genuine connection to prior material; a freshly created entity is not.
