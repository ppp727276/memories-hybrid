/**
 * Throw if `target` is not the vault root or a descendant of it.
 *
 * The check is twofold:
 *
 *   1. `path.resolve` normalises `..` so a slug like `../etc/passwd`
 *      cannot pretend to be inside the vault. The platform path
 *      separator (`/` or `\`) is used for the prefix check so siblings
 *      that share a name prefix (`/v` vs `/v-evil`) are rejected.
 *   2. `fs.realpathSync` follows symlinks for the deepest existing
 *      ancestor of the target, then re-runs the prefix check on the
 *      resolved real paths. This blocks the case where a directory
 *      *inside* the vault is itself a symlink to somewhere outside it
 *      (`<vault>/Brain/payments/escape -> /tmp/outside`) — without
 *      realpath, the lexical check would happily admit the path.
 *
 * Returns the resolved (lexical) absolute path of `target`. Callers that
 * need the realpath should call `realpathSync` themselves on the result;
 * we deliberately return the lexical form so wikilinks rendered from it
 * keep matching what the user sees in Obsidian.
