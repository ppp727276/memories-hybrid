/**
 * Read-time enrichment for brain_search results (Search & Recall Quality
 * Suite). The sibling of `recall-hint.ts`: every projection here is
 * computed at read time over an already-ranked result and is NEVER
 * stored. Pure - no I/O, no clock unless injected.
 *
 * Three projections live here as the suite lands:
 *   - `projectScoreBreakdown` - the structured per-layer score components
 *     surfaced under the MCP `explain` flag;
 *   - inline trust metadata (age / superseded / conflict);
 *   - hybrid-degrade detection.
 *
 * Language-agnostic by construction: every output is a number, a boolean,
 * or an identifier already present in the data - no per-locale phrase
 * table, consistent with the project's single-authoring-language stance.
