/**
 * Writer WAL-flush-on-exit registry (Indexer Durability suite,
 * t_672c751e).
 *
 * The search store runs in WAL mode. An orderly `Store.close()`
 * consolidates the WAL (`wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` then
 * `journal_mode=DELETE`) and releases the lock. When `close()` is
 * bypassed - an error path that calls `process.exit`, or a signal
 * handler that lets the process exit normally - an orphan `-wal` is
 * left next to the main DB. SQLite replays it on the next open, so no
 * data is lost; this registry is a belt-and-suspenders that
 * synchronously consolidates the WAL for every still-open writer on the
 * process `exit` event, mirroring `sync-lockfile.ts`'s cleanup hook.
 *
 * It is best-effort and synchronous (bun:sqlite is synchronous and the
 * `exit` event cannot await async work): every operation is wrapped so
 * the hook can never throw. A hard kill (SIGKILL) fires no `exit`
 * event; that case relies on SQLite's own WAL replay on the next open.
 *
 * The registry holds a strong reference until `Store.close()`
 * unregisters it. Every code path that opens a writer closes it in a
 * `finally`, so handles do not accumulate over a long-lived process;
 * the set holds only the writers currently open.
