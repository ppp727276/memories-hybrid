/**
 * Pure Weibull recency decay (v0.20.0).
 *
 * Replaces the prior hardcoded step function (<=7d -> 0.05, <=30d ->
 * 0.025, <=90d -> 0.01, else 0) with a continuous, configurable curve so
 * a vault can tune how fast older content loses its recency boost.
 *
 * The boost is the Weibull survival function scaled by an amplitude:
 *
 *   boost(age) = amplitude * exp( -(age / scale)^shape )
 *
 * At age 0 the survival term is 1, so the boost equals `amplitude` (the
 * maximum). As age grows the boost decays monotonically toward 0. `shape`
 * controls the curvature (k); `scale` is the characteristic lifetime in
 * days (lambda). The defaults approximate the old step function while
 * smoothing the cliffs at the 7/30/90-day boundaries.
 *
 * The function is pure and deterministic: no Date.now(), no Math.random().
 * Callers pass an already-computed age in days, so the time source stays
 * injectable at the ranker boundary.
