/**
 * Cross-encoder rerank provider abstraction (retrieval-precision-quality-loop,
 * card A / t_110867f5).
 *
 * A rerank provider jointly re-scores a query against a set of candidate
 * documents and returns one relevance score per document, aligned to the
 * input order. Unlike the embedding provider (which vectorises text for
 * the index), a rerank provider is a READ-TIME final reader step: it takes
 * the already-fused, heuristically-ranked top-K candidates and produces a
 * learned re-scoring the deterministic core cannot.
 *
 * The interface is intentionally minimal so a test can inject a
 * deterministic stub without any HTTP, and so alternate learned rerankers
 * (a local model, a different endpoint shape) can implement it later.
 *
 * Mirrors `embeddings/provider.ts`'s discipline: the module graph stays
 * small (the OpenAI-compatible implementation is imported lazily by the
 * factory) so a vault that never enables rerank pays nothing.
