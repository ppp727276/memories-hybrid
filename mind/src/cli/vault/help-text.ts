Vault-wide exclusion policy inspection. The policy lives in
<vault>/Brain/_brain.yaml under \`vault.ignore_paths\` (single source
of truth for the search indexer, scan-inline, and future scanners).

verbs:
  status              Walk the vault under the active policy and
                      report inclusion / exclusion counts.
  inspect <relpath>   Point-check one vault-relative path with the
                      matched rule.
  profile <sub>       Manage named multi-vault profiles
                      (list | create <name> <vault> | switch <name>).
  map [show]          Print the resolved vault-map (role token -> folder).

global flags:
  --vault <path>      Override the configured vault path.
  --json              Emit a machine-readable JSON payload.
