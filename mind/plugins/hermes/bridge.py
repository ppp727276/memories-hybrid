"""Bridge from the Python memory provider to the Open Second Brain TS core.

The provider never reimplements deterministic memory logic; it forwards work
to the existing ``o2b mcp`` stdio server over MCP JSON-RPC. ``BrainBridge`` is
the seam: ``McpBrainBridge`` is the production backend that owns a long-lived
``o2b mcp`` subprocess, and ``FakeBrainBridge`` lets tests exercise the
provider with no live Bun runtime.

Splitting ``JsonRpcStdioClient`` (pure framing) from ``McpBrainBridge`` (process
lifecycle) keeps each class single-responsibility and lets the framing be
unit-tested against in-memory streams.
