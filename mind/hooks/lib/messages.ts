/**
 * Hook-side reminder texts. Kept in one module so the wording stays
 * consistent across the PostToolUse reminder and the Stop guardrail,
 * and so it can be tested without spinning up a hook process.
 *
 * The text is deliberately written for the LLM consumer (a coding
 * agent), not the human user — the human only ever sees a status
 * line. Tone: factual, terse, no exclamation marks, no apology.
 *
 * These messages are emitted in English because the hooks run in the
 * agent's runtime, not in a conversation context — the language
 * choice for the *event log entry itself* still follows the
 * conversation locale per the `agent-event-log` skill.
 *
 * §4-tail (v0.10.5): a per-runtime cadence line is interpolated
 * between the opening sentence and the rest of the reminder when the
 * payload-shape detector resolves to `claudecode` or `codex`. The
 * `unknown` branch renders byte-identical to the v0.10.4 baseline so
 * old hook installs and unfamiliar runtimes are not affected.
